# CMPE 103 OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
```
LAB EXERCISE No. 3 – The Vigenère Cipher
```

## Task Instruction:
   Write a program that asks the user for the plaintext (all uppercase letters, no spaces) and the keyword (all uppercase letters) and produce the ciphertext using the Vigenère cipher.
   
### The Vigenère Cipher works as follows:
  Your key is a keyword, which you then translate into corresponding letter values 0 – 25. Then, to encrypt, write your message on one row (letters 0 – 25), and repeatedly write the keyword below it, adding each column, taking the result mod 26. These resultant numbers are the ciphertext.

## Modules Used:
Kindly install the following modules for the program to work properly.
* Pyfiglet
* colorama
* Rich
* pyboxen

## This Program contains the following:
* While Loop
* If-Else Statements
* For Loops
* upper() method
* index() method
* append() method
* string repeat function
* string concatenation
